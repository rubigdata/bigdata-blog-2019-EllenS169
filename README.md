# Ellen's blog 

This is my Markdown sample blog. Below I am trying out how to use bullet lists (once ordered and once unordered)

This is an unordered bulletlist:
- first item
- second item
- third item

This is an ordered bulletlist:
1. item
2. item
3. item

# A very interesting header

## An even more interesting subheader

If you want to stress something you can use **Bold** and *Italic* markup.

Here is  the link to the [course site on brightspace](https://brightspace.ru.nl/d2l/home/13189).

And lots more, to see what you can do with Markdown (including images, and tables) take a look at the [Cheatsheet][cheat] (an example of a very useful feature to separate actual links from their references in your text).
